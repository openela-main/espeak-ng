+# espeak-ng(1) - A multi-lingual software speech synthesizer.
+{: data-date="July 2018"}
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+__espeak-ng__ \[*options*\] \[*words*\]
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+__espeak-ng__ is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other
+languages.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-h`, `--help`
+:   Show summary of options.
+
+`--version`
+:   Prints the espeak library version and the location of the espeak voice
+    data.
+
+`-f <text file>`
+:   Text file to speak.
+
+`--stdin`
+:   Read text input from stdin instead of a file.
+
+If neither `-f` nor `--stdin` are provided, `<words>` are spoken, or if no
+words are provided then text is spoken from stdin a line at a time.
+
+`-d <device>`
+:   Use the specified device to speak the audio on. If not specified, the
+    default audio device is used.
+
+`-q`
+:   Quiet, don't produce any speech (may be useful with `-x`).
+
+`-a <integer>`
+:   Amplitude, 0 to 200, default is 100.
+
+`-g <integer>`
+:   Word gap. Pause between words, units of 10ms at the default speed.
+
+`-k <integer>`
+:   Indicate capital letters with: 1=sound, 2=the word \"capitals\", higher
+    values = a pitch increase (try `-k20`).
+
+`-l <integer>`
+:   Line length. If not zero (which is the default), consider lines less than
+    this length as end-of-clause.
+
+`-p <integer>`
+:   Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50.
+
+`-s <integer>`
+:   Speed in words per minute, default is 160.
+
+`-v <voice name>`
+:   Use voice file of this name from espeak-ng-data/voices. A variant can be
+    specified using _voice_+_variant_, such as af+m3.
+
+`-w <wave file name>`
+:   Write output to this WAV file, rather than speaking it directly.
+
+`--split=<minutes>`
+:   Used with `-w` to split the audio output into \<minutes\> recorded
+    chunks.
+
+`-b`
+:   Input text encoding, 1=UTF8, 2=8 bit, 4=16 bit.
+
+`-m`
+:   Indicates that the text contains SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)
+    tags or other XML tags. Those SSML tags which are supported are
+    interpreted. Other tags, including HTML, are ignored, except that some HTML
+    tags such as \<hr\> \<h2\> and \<li\> ensure a break in the speech.
+
+`-x`
+:   Write phoneme mnemonics to stdout.
+
+`-X`
+:   Write phonemes mnemonics and translation trace to stdout. If rules files
+    have been built with `--compile=debug`, line numbers will also be displayed.
+
+`-z`
+:   No final sentence pause at the end of the text.
+
+`--stdout`
+:   Write speech output to stdout.
+
+`--compile=voicename`
+:   Compile the pronunciation rules and dictionary in the current directory.
+    =\<voicename\> is optional and specifies which language is compiled.
+
+`--compile-debug=voicename`
+:   Compile the pronunciation rules and dictionary in the current directory as
+    above, but include line numbers, that get shown when `-X` is used.
+
+`--ipa`
+:   Write phonemes to stdout using International Phonetic Alphabet. `--ipa=1`
+    Use ties, `--ipa=2` Use ZWJ, `--ipa=3` Separate with _.
+
+`--tie=<character>`
+:   The character to use to join multi-letter phonemes in `-x` and `--ipa`
+    output.
+
+`--path=<path>`
+:   Specifies the directory containing the espeak-ng-data directory.
+
+`--pho`
+:   Write mbrola phoneme data (.pho) to stdout or to the file in `--phonout`.
+
+`--phonout=<filename>`
+:   Write output from `-x` `-X` commands and mbrola phoneme data to this file.
+
+`--punct="<characters>"`
+:   Speak the names of punctuation characters during speaking. If
+    =\<characters\> is omitted, all punctuation is spoken.
+
+`--sep=<character>`
+:   The character to separate phonemes from the `-x` and `--ipa` output.
+
+`--voices[=<language code>]`
+:   Lists the available voices. If =\<language code\> is present then only
+    those voices which are suitable for that language are listed.
+
+`--voices=<directory>`
+:   Lists the voices in the specified subdirectory.
+
+## EXAMPLES
+
+`espeak-ng "This is a test"`
+:   Speak the sentence \"This is a test\" using the default English voice.
+
+`espeak-ng -f hello.txt`
+:   Speak the contents of hello.txt using the default English voice.
+
+`cat hello.txt | espeak-ng`
+:   Speak the contents of hello.txt using the default English voice.
+
+`espeak-ng -x hello`
+:   Speak the word \"hello\" using the default English voice, and print the
+    phonemes that were spoken.
+
+`espeak-ng -ven-us "[[h@'loU]]"`
+:   Speak the phonemes \"h@'loU\" using the American English voice.
+
+`espeak-ng --voices`
+:   List all voices supported by eSpeak.
+
+`espeak-ng --voices=en`
+:   List all voices that speak English (`en`).
+
+`espeak-ng --voices=mb`
+:   List all voices using the MBROLA voice synthesizer.
